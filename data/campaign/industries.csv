Time needed to build even a single ship is very high on soely Orbital Works, but if for example you build the base engine parts via Ornium Production style Shipyards, it will cut time almost 7 times. This allows Dermond ships to be built extremly fast and at the same time not caring that much about quality.",3665,HIGH

The reason why their academies are placed on planets may differ and may actually just be that orbital stations are too small for their equipment.

The research station on $market is due to AI or ship research reasons. This academy for example focuses more on AI research and creating more advanced level AI cores. Hegemony keeps an eye on this research complex due to it being the last official AI Core creating facility.",3667,HIGH

der_hives,Hive Breeding Anthills,1.9,2350,,750,,,industry,,,data.campaign.econ.industries.der_ordo_breeder,"Whilist to become one of the citizens of Ordo Aeterni you have to go threw Ascension... But what if you are not worthy? Well for that Ordo have made a new way, completly remaking people.

This is seen as the most inhumane thing what Ordo Have ever done, but the worst is how it all is done. After going threw Factorem, which is commonly called ""The Meat Grinder"", a lot of skin and human insides are left and same is with the soul. So they simply combine everything and then throw it into the Hive, where it then grows together, and it is later used to make more people. These are MUCH more loyal to Ordo, than normal Ascensionists, but they are also more braindead.

Cultists which pass Anthills, commonly have only 3 things they want, that is: Sex, Worship and Death of everything that doesn't worship their God.",3670,HIGH
