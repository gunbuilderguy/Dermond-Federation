This Hull Modification Extra Description is version 0.03b, which means it not displays everything correctly(wow)!\n\nNow let's see how can this Hull Modification kill you!\n\nThis Hull Modification decreases the effectivnes on Hull armour and ship armour by %s.  \n\nThis Hull Modification decreases shield efficency by %s. \n\nThis Hull Modification increases the amount of time needed to phase in and phase out by %s.\n\nThis Hull Modification modifies the ships Engines so that the ships speed and turn rate is increased by %s.\n\nThis Hull Modification overrides Flux safety protocols thus resulting in Flux Statistics being increased by %s.\n\n And last ships Peak Performance Time is increased by %s! \n\nWe at Baller Incorporated hope you will have a good time!",
