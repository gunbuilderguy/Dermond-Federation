DER_Fermond,SHIP,"A very big Heavy Fighter, being closer to a frigate than an actual fighter, but who are we to blame if MVS has something similar. Being very robust and very heavily armed it has become slow and easy target at long ranges, but is very  dangerous if close to the enemy.",,,,
DER_Dentor,SHIP,"An unknown fighter with mystirious origin, being very similar to infamous Dermond Federation's fighter wing, being classified as ""Light Interceptor"" in chips database it is very powerful, and cannot be replicated or found anywhere else. Since The ""Light Interceptors"" configuration and insides are very complicated it cannot go to far away from the carrier.",,,,
DER_Dolbre,SHIP,"An interesting ship with unknown origin. A lot of data suggests that it is from an infamous Dermond Federation, but the question rises, how did it get here? The closest Federations outpost is 100 light years away from the core worlds. Being built with an unknown flux core in the ships center, the Dolbre as the ships data suggests is very powerful in hit and run tactics, and also has a very complicated system which makes maintanance of this ship hell for ordinary crew.",,,,
DER_Protahta,SHIP,"A quite interesting piece of metal, being classified as a Strik Experimental Cruiser. Protahta is armed with 3 flux cores all working as a part of bigger one. Because of unbeliveble complexity of construction Protahta is very maintanence hungry, making it a very bad ship for long range epxeditions.",,,,

dermond_hunter_AI,RESOURCE,"""it is still unknown how something like this existed in our universe. After rechecking data storage of this Broken AI core it somehow turned back online... I had a conversation with it for around 20 minutes before it asked 'can i be connectedto your ship?' To which I logically responded no. I sitll left it in my ship and not destroying it. When I came close to Hegemony administrated system the AI core said that we are being followed by Phase ships, I didn't believe it... Untill it was too late. My last option was to connect it to the ship, before we were about to get gunned down...""",,,,

DER_luje,SHIP,"Mainly designed as a Ground Suport Mech, Luje has become sort of a propoganda tool due to how many are in service in Dermond Militia, and Marine corp. There is a saying: ""If you come to Dermond, be ready to face atleast 30 000 of these.""",,,,

der_mentalor_launcher,WEAPON,"Quite interesting LRM being very similar to Salamndra, but having highly efficent nanorforge which allows for record speed of amount of missile being launched from a single pod.",,,,

der_altoh,CUSTOM,"Altoh is a very rich rare ore deposit planet, but is quite poor when comes to normal ore. Around 340 cycles ago a planet collided with Altoh resulting in a dense asteroid ring created around the planet. Due to that the remainings of what was that planet can now be easily mined, resulting in Altoh being a very rich in ore planet. Even though the population of Altoh is high, it only takes in workers which know that they might die, since the remaining of the planet had some organisms... What were those organisms is kept a secret.


Altoh is also the main hub for the Dermondian Military High Command, and Dermondian Marine Corp. This result's in Altoh being more heavily armed and defended than Bandore.",,,,
der_bandore,CUSTOM,"Bandore is the main hub of Dermond in the Persean Sector. Being located on the edge of the sector it is kept relitevly quite. But recently a lot of traiding convoys were raided by the pirates resulting in Bandore parlament declaring Martial Law on the planet in densly populated zones, this has made the need of qualified officers in high demand, which resulted in revival of Dermond Federal Officer Training Commitee.


To this day it is unknown what is the deal with the slaves about which records from cycle 126 suggest, many say that they were freed as a part of ""Free Mans"" legeslation campaing. Many are opposing this information. Many say that children of those slaves are still working on the famous Ornium Production Shipyards.",,,,
der_blockno,CUSTOM,"About what has happend on Blockno is very scarce. When Dermond call that Tri-Tachyon were keeping there tens of millions of slaves before the collapse, almost nobody believed them before the revolts of Tri-Tachyon systems.


Blockno's scientific infrastructure is irreplacable and thus Blockno has become the main hub of Science in the Bontora system. To this day it is still unknown how Dermond was able to create that much Alpha AI cores in such a short period of time, but all the information we have points at a secret lab on Blockno and 1st AI war.",,,,
der_bronsta,CUSTOM,"Bronsta almost any fleet commander with the right papers can come here and trade, unless they are hunted by the Federation.


In cycle 178 an incident occured of Bronsta, and due to that the Bronsta Planet Administrator Office declared Martial Law and the Marine Corp was called in. The result in the next 3 cycles was total eradication of religion from this planet.",,,,
der_yodora,CUSTOM,"Yodora is known for it's HUGE planet deposits, due to unknown reasons the planet was seen not in dissapearance of deposits but it's increase each 10 cycles. The planet due to unknown reasons has some sort of time & space anomaly. This has resulted in Yodora being a closed planet with primarily miner population.",,,,

dermond_federation,FACTION,"“Dermond Federation, or as it's official name ""The 5th Dermond Federation"" is a Terrorist State from the time before Domain, but it was not always a Terrorist State. 

Today what we call Dermond is nothing close in comparison what it was before. Dermond first of all is a nationality, Dermondians before Domain was established were making up a heavy part of Domain population, but rather than recognizing themselves as a part of singular Human Race, Dermondian went and wanted to get autonomy for their own planets, when it failed to get recognition it started a Democratic Opposition against Domain, but never gained an upper hand. One day Dermondian Party leader Soi Pükei was assassinated presumably by Domain Secret Service as a dangerous politician who went against Domain. His death started The First Dermond Revolution. This revolution was swiftly crushed, but after it had ended many of Dermond planets evacuated from their planets in search of a better home. 

After some time 2nd Dermond Revolution started, this time Dermond has transformed from a Democratic Opposition to a Federalized State, with it's own Navy and government. The 2nd Dermond revolution almost destroyed Domain, until it was bailed out by multiple Domain Megacorporation’s as we know them today. As a result of 2nd Dermond Revolution Domain did not loose a single bit of land, but got a lot of problems with rebels, this event is what started all of Domain Rebellions.

After the successful establishment of The 2nd Dermond Federation the main ruling faction split into 2 entities, the Idealists and Pragmatists. While Idealists focused on bringing greater democracy and freedom, Realists wanted to build a nation which could withstand the aggression of Domain. They knew they couldn’t destroy Domain at its current form, but they will be able if they start destroying Domain from within.

In the power struggle that followed, Idealists have won, but Realists did not loose completely, they in fact almost won, if the population did not sway in favor of Idealists. Thus begun a very long power struggle between Military and Civilian Administration. This did not go too well with both, so they decided to infiltrate both specialties and as we know today Civilian Administration went All-In in calling a referendum for the establishment of The 3rd Dermond Federation. Military protested this and called this to be illegitimate as many opposers did. The ruling Left Wing coalition backed the referendum and the opposition were not able to stop it. The new constitution removed the posts of President, and removed the ability of the military to interfere with the Civilian Administrations.

The 3rd Dermond Federation started off with a coup lead by the military, and after a few months Domain declared war on Dermond to bring them down while they were in the middle of the civil war. This event is known in Dermond history books as The Failed Dream. After this Dermond was not completely destroyed and a small Liberal government was put in charge of Dermond by Domain what is known by today. This government was more violent and even more unstable, but Dermond history books still claim it as a part of Dermond states.

The 4th Dermond Federation was an unstable Free Market Libertarian State, where local planets held all bits of power, and having ability to not follow orders from The Federal Government. This was both a good and a bad time for Dermond as Dermond Insurgency Army slowly conquered back all the planets and declaring war on Domain to push them back. From what is known today it failed completely, and as a result more than 800 million Dermondians were killed not only in battles, but also on independent planets. This is why Dermond has a very anti-sector policy and does not trust anybody.

For almost a decade new Dermond Federation was not established at all, but The Dream lived on. And the remainings of Dermond Federation Insurgency Army have decided to establish a new Dermond Federation. The new constitution which came with the new Federation had been given a nickname by most analytics “The State which will never Die”. It is due to the paragraph 2 of The New Constitution which states:

“Dermond Federation, is not simply a State, like Domain, it’s an idea like Domain. The idea where Dermondians and all other could’ve lived together. But Dermond was destroyed by the ones it was trying to help. 5th Dermond Federations only task is Survival. If Dermond shall fall, so shall Humanity.”

The new constitution had given The Military more power than ever, allowing them to interfere with the elections and call new in. But it has given them a counterbalance in which military can’t create a party of their own, and no such party in the parliament has to be lead by an ex-military officer.

The new constitution made people allowed to bear any arms, and to protect the new state, but it was later modified to be mandatory. This has resulted in Dermond having more weapons than people. But after The Collapse their stockpile have begun to wither down, so they decided to use slaves in the first 50 cycles, after being rediscovered. Persean Sector have had raids from Dermond before 9th Battlegroup left, and many call that Dermond was the sole reason why The Gate system have had been disabled.

But there is a lot of places where history does not meet reality. All history up to 3rd Federations establishment is real, but all what follows does not… There is something interesting happening here…”
