I do not take responsobility if your save gets bricked, or if it isn't fun for you.
This mod was released for the shits and giggles most of the content inside the mod is stolen, but sprites I try to make myself.
Portraits I either try do draw or make with AI.





Some of the ships the mod has is not made by me and here is the list by whom these ships are made:
Tomatopaste



Most(around 74%) of the code is taken from other mods, if you find which code is taken from what mod then good job! But in case some people wonder from where I took code then here:
DME, ARC, Hullmods Expansion, Tahlan



Special thanks to Banano, willthefunperson, jujutex and ruddy for helping with code, Jackundor with Banano for helping with icons.
And overall Special Thanks to the Entire Corvus, the people there might be retarded but when it comes to modding people are ready to help.
And also special thanks to Seven, and Danto for allowing to use their mod for AI intergration in the Hullmod test beta and in this version also.
And finally Pogre. The base mod was based on bultach files and he knows it.





Oh and also, why do you open sus txt files?
Your save just got brikked! - Probably Lortus?




The music this mod has is not made by me, but made by other people.

Music from people I HAVE asked to use, and they allowed:
Ordo Aeterni Base theme: Venturer - Faithless

Music from people I DID NOT ask permission to use:
All Dermond faction music: Irving Force (I do not remember what music is what exactly but all music is made by them)


Also I will remove the music from the mod if the owner will tell me to do so, as long as they don't enjoy the music!
If Meso will ask me to remove music I will do so in the next update also.
