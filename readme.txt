TLDR - Useless piece of shit this is, idfk why I wrote it



BASIC STUFF:
I do not take responsibility if your save gets bricked, or if it isn't fun for you.
The main idea of this mod at first was for shits and giggles, and to show that some braindead people like me(Glywnok) are able to make some niche mods, cause you can just bash code for cool results or just reverse engineer stuff.
The sprites and portaits are made by HuginBlair, any questions about them goes to him, anything related about code you can ask me.



The mods Developers:
Glywnok - Main code guy, Main Worldbuilder,
HuginBlair - Main Spriter, Worldbulding supporter
Staer(sort of) - A sane person who helps me(Glywnok) with story building and political shenanigans.



Srpites this mod have are made by:
Tomatopaste(Two ships and Space Station)
HuginBlair(Main basher)



Code and shit:
To any or all question how it works you may also just listen to these 2 seconds

Most(around 78%) of the code is taken from other mods, if you find which code is taken from what mod then good job! But in case some people wonder from where I took code then here:
DME, ARC, Hullmods Expansion, Tahlan, Blackrock




Credits:

Special thanks to Banano, willthefunperson, jujutex and ruddy for helping with code, Jackundor with Banano for helping with icons.
And overall Special Thanks to the Entire Corvus, the people there might be retarded but when it comes to modding people are ready to help.
And also special thanks to Seven, and Danto for allowing to use their mod for AI integration in the Hullmod test beta and in this version also.
And finally Pogre. The base mod was based on bultach files and he knows it.

The biggest Thank you goes to Hugin because without him the base mod would look like shit, and he is the guy who helped me make as it looks right now.

Music from people I HAVE asked to use, and they allowed:
Ordo Aeterni Base theme: Venturer - Faithless (Thanks dude, I am very happy that I can share some good music with other people)

Music from people I DID NOT ask permission to use:
All Dermond faction music: Irving Force (I do not remember what music is what exactly but all music is made by them)

Most of the sound effect are made by not us.







Oh and also, why do you open sus txt files?
Your save just got brikked! - Probably Lortus?





Also I will remove the music from the mod if the owner will tell me to do so, as long as they don't enjoy the music!
If Meso will ask me to remove music I will do so in the next update also.






































Shitpost about how we develop the mod:
Glywnok: Ok I have a very crazy idea, how about we do X, then we add Y, and then we make Y being able to work with Z which in fact works with X, which kills Y?
HuginBlar: You  are a crazy man, but I like your idea
